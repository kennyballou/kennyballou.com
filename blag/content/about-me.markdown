I am a life-long learner, developer, mathematician, and overall thinker. I
enjoy solving problems and learning about technologies and discussing new and
different ideas.

I graduated from Boise State University, majoring in Applied Mathematics and
minored in Computer Science. I've been programming professionally for nearly a
decade and currently am working as a software developer for zData Inc. in
Boise, Idaho.

Outside of developing professionally, I am active in the open source community,
contributing where I can.

When I am not developing, I enjoy reading, learning, and shredding the local
mountains.

Sometimes I `:() { :|:& };:`.

Other times I `import this`.

The one I choose today: `fork: retry: Resource temporarily unavailable`.
